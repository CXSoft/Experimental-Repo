Why, hello there!

Welcome to the Experimental repository. This is my scratchpad where I store all my quick'n'dirty scripts and projects. Code quality may be rough around the edges, so please don't complain if and when the programs break. Pull requests and comments are welcome.

## Compatibility
Nothing in this repository is guaranteed to work on platform X or architecture Y. Use discretion and some common sense; e.g. a Batch or Powershell script is intended to work on Windows XP and newer, ANSI-compliant C/C++ is platform agnostic, etc.

UNIX shell scripts from this repository are developed for GNU bash (3.2+) atop a 64-bit Arch Linux platform. Keep this in mind should certain scripts fail or behave erratically on a BSD or Solaris variant.
